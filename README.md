# oc-fennel

The [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) programming language, packaged for OpenComputers.

## Installation

You can install the package vie `oppm`

```sh
oppm register 0x5a4/oc-fennel
```

and then install fennel with

```sh
oppm install fennel
```

This will install the `fennel` script you're used to and the fennel library. All of this combined will use about 300KB of disk space, so a tier 2 disk is propably recommended.
